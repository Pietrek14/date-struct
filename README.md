# date-struct

It's a homework project to practice operator overloading in C++. It contains a simple date struct storing day, month and year. You can:
 - print out the date in format **dd-mm-yyyy**
 - input the date in format **dd mm yyyy**
 - set the date to the date a day later by post-incrementing 
 - calculate the difference between dates by subtracting them
 - check if the two dates are equal
 - check if one date is before or after another by using < and > signs

The project uses GNU make and clang++ as the C++ compiler.

## Make commands
 - **make / make build** - builds the project
 - **make run** - runs the project
 - **make clean** - deletes the executable
